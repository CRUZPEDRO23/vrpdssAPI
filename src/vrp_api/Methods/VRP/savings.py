    """
    Implementation of the basic savings algorithm / construction heuristic for
    capaciated vehicle routing problems with symmetric distances (see, e.g.
    Clarke-Wright (1964)). This is the parallel route version, aka. best
    feasible merge version, that builds all of the routes in the solution in
    parallel making always the best possible merge (according to varied savings
    criteria, see below).
    
    * Cost_Matrix is a numpy ndarray (or equvalent) of the full 2D distance matrix.
    * d_i         is a list of demands. d_i[0:n_sats] should be 0.0 as it is the depot and satellites.
    * Q2          is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    * C           is the customer list
    
    * optional savings_callback is a function of the signature:
        sorted([(s_11,x_11,i_1,j_1)...(s_ij,x_ij,i,j)...(s_nn,x_nn,n,n) ]) =
            savings_callback(D)
      where the returned (sorted!) list contains savings (that is, how much 
       solution cost approximately improves if a route merge with an edge
       (i,j) is made). This should be calculated for each i \in {1..n},
       j \\in {i+1..n}, where n is the number of customers. The x is a secondary
       sorting criterion but otherwise ignored by the savings heuristic.
      The default is to use the Clarke Wright savings criterion.
